    <p>People of different ages and backgrounds are successfully conducting business around the world. For survival and basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing, everyone is welcome to enter the business world and make a profit. There are several ways to go about starting a business, some of which require a business plan, while others don't. Depending on the original strategy, we have both a huge and a small business. As a student, I don't have a lot of practical work experience to draw on. To succeed, all I have to do is strive to get involved in various business industries, and my job as a sales representative for Demica Beauty Team is not particularly difficult.</p>

      <p>Ideas are the driving force behind all businesses. As a student, it was only natural for me to be curious about how companies operate and what their competitive advantages are. Still, owning my own business has always seemed far away. Running your own firm has given me the motivation to investigate any new business idea and conduct a feasibility analysis. Any business must conduct a feasibility study, and my own entrepreneurial journey has taught me a lot about the importance of doing so.</p>

      <h4><b>Top Sales for Sales Marketing</b></h4>
      <p>Alhamdulillah, for the accolades I received in 2020. Although we are still dealing with the effects of the pandemic, that was undoubtedly my best year to date. I was recognised as our team's top salesperson in recognition of sales growth in 2020. Although it is not the finest year for everyone, there is certainly some sweetness to be found in the midst of the gloom.</p>
